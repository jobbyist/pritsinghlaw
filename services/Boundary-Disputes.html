    <h1>Boundary &amp; Property Line Disputes</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>Nothing tests “love thy neighbor” quite like a fence that’s six inches too far into your yard. Boundary disputes in the Bay Area—especially where property values are sky-high—can quickly turn into all-out wars over inches of land, shared driveways, or misplaced fences.</p>
<p>We represent homeowners, landlords, and property owners in boundary disputes, encroachment claims, and easement conflicts across San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, Fremont, and surrounding areas. Whether it’s negotiating a fair resolution or taking the fight to court, we make sure your property rights are fully protected.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a Boundary Dispute Consultation and let’s put a stop to the property drama.</strong></p>
<p>What Are Boundary Disputes?</p>
<p>A boundary dispute arises when neighbors disagree about the true location of a property line or ownership rights. These disputes often involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encroachments: A fence, retaining wall, or structure crossing onto your property.</li>
<li>Shared Driveways &amp; Access Roads: Neighbors arguing over usage rights.</li>
<li>Tree Disputes: Who’s responsible when tree roots or branches cross the line?</li>
<li>Survey Conflicts: Mismatched or outdated property surveys.</li>
</ul>
<p>How California Law Handles Boundary Disputes</p>
<p>California property law requires that ownership lines be proven with title deeds, recorded surveys, and boundary markers. When disputes can’t be resolved amicably, they often lead to legal claims like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiet Title Actions: Filed under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 760.010, this lawsuit formally resolves property line disputes.</li>
<li>Easement Litigation: Determining whether a neighbor has a legal right to use part of your property for access, utilities, or other purposes.</li>
<li>Encroachment &amp; Removal Claims: When a structure or improvement crosses the line.</li>
<li>Adverse Possession &amp; Prescriptive Easements: Sometimes neighbors claim rights to your land simply because they’ve been using it for years. Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 325, adverse possession claims require open, hostile, and continuous use for five years plus payment of property taxes. Prescriptive easements require similar proof of continuous use but don’t transfer ownership—just usage rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this legal theory, we fight these claims aggressively to protect your property, or perhaps we pursue them so that you can claim rightful title. Book your case review today.</p>
<p>Why Boundary Disputes Are Tricky in the Bay Area</p>
<p>With tight lot lines and multi-million-dollar properties, even a tiny encroachment can create huge financial consequences. Add to that the patchwork of city ordinances—like Berkeley’s strict building code restrictions or San Francisco’s neighbor notification rules—and these cases can get complicated fast.</p>
<p>What We Do for You</p>
<p>We take a strategic, problem-solving approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze surveys and deeds to determine the true legal boundary.</li>

<p>When to Call a Lawyer</p>
<p>If your neighbor just built a new fence, is claiming part of your yard, or is blocking access to your driveway, don’t wait. The longer you delay, the more complicated (and expensive) the problem becomes—especially if adverse possession or prescriptive easements come into play.</p>
