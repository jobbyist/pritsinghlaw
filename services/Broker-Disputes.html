    <h1>Property Broker Disputes</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>Real estate brokers and agents are supposed to guide you, not mislead you. But in California’s fast-moving market, broker disputes are all too common—whether it’s about commissions, misrepresentations, or negligence. We represent property owners, buyers, and landlords across San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, and beyond when broker actions (or inactions) cause financial loss or legal trouble.</p>

<p>When Broker Disputes Arise</p>
<p>Brokers and agents owe their clients a fiduciary duty—a legal obligation to act in the client’s best interests. When they fail to do so, disputes often arise over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commissions: Disagreements about who is entitled to a commission or how it was calculated.</li>
<li>Misrepresentation or Non-Disclosure: Failing to disclose known defects or material facts, violating Civ. Code § 2079.</li>
<li>Negligence: Providing poor advice, overlooking property defects, or failing to meet professional standards.</li>
<li>Conflict of Interest: Brokers working in their own interest instead of yours.</li>
<li>Dual Agency Issues: Brokers representing both buyer and seller without proper disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>What We Will Do for You</p>
<p>We approach property broker disputes with strategy and precision. First, we investigate all communications, contracts, and disclosures to understand exactly what went wrong. We then assess whether the broker violated their fiduciary duty, misrepresented facts, or breached California Department of Real Estate (DRE) regulations.</p>
<p>As members of the California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.), we are deeply familiar with C.A.R. forms, standards, and procedures, which allows us to pinpoint errors in broker documentation and enforce compliance.</p>
<p>We’re prepared to negotiate settlements, pursue arbitration or mediation, or take the dispute to court if needed. We know that these cases often involve high stakes—whether it’s a disputed commission or a major financial loss due to misrepresentation—and we fight to recover what you deserve.</p>
<p>Common Claims We Handle</p>
<ul>
<li>Commission Disputes: Conflicts over commission splits, referral fees, or disputes between brokers and clients.</li>
<li>Fraud and Misrepresentation: From undisclosed property damage to zoning restrictions, we hold brokers accountable for false statements or omissions.</li>
<li>Breach of Fiduciary Duty: We pursue claims when a broker acts in bad faith or fails to protect your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Broker Disputes Are Unique in the Bay Area</p>
