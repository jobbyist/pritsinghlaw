    <h1>Real Estate Closings</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>The final step in a real estate transaction—closing—is where everything comes together: funds transfer, title recording, and final documents. It’s also where last-minute issues can cause delays, disputes, or even kill the deal. From San Francisco and Oakland to Berkeley, Richmond, and Fremont, we ensure that every detail of your real estate closing is handled correctly so that you can focus on the excitement of moving forward, not legal complications.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a Closing Consultation to ensure your transaction closes without surprises.</strong></p>
<p>What We Do During a Closing</p>
<p>A closing involves coordination between buyers, sellers, lenders, escrow officers, and title companies, with dozens of documents to review and sign. Our role is to protect your interests from start to finish by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing and Finalizing Documents: We carefully review escrow instructions, title reports, settlement statements, and loan documents for accuracy.</li>
<li>Resolving Title Issues: We identify and clear liens, claims, or errors that could cloud your ownership.</li>
<li>Coordinating Escrow and Funding: We ensure that funds are transferred safely and all terms are met before closing.</li>
<li>Addressing Last-Minute Disputes: Whether it’s a repair credit or an occupancy issue, we negotiate and resolve conflicts quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Importance of Title and Escrow Review</p>
<p>A title report isn’t just paperwork—it’s your proof of ownership. We verify that the title is free from hidden liens, easements, or claims that could affect your property rights. We also scrutinize escrow instructions to ensure they align with your purchase agreement and protect your deposit.</p>
<p>Common Closing Challenges We Solve</p>
<p>Closings are often where surprises pop up—unpaid liens, missing permits, or unexpected charges. We step in to handle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrepancies in closing costs or settlement statements.</li>

<li>Escrow or title company errors.</li>
