    <h1>Property Financing Documents</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>Real estate financing in California can be complex, involving promissory notes, deeds of trust, loan agreements, and security instruments that must all work together flawlessly. A single poorly drafted clause can create disputes, threaten your collateral, or even derail your transaction.</p>
<p>We help homeowners, landlords, and investors across San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, and the greater Bay Area draft, review, and troubleshoot property financing documents. Whether you’re borrowing, lending, or investing, our job is to ensure your financing agreements are legally enforceable, transparent, and risk-proof.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a Financing Document Consultation and let us secure your interests before closing.</strong></p>
<p>What We Do for You</p>
<p>Financing documents define your rights, responsibilities, and remedies if something goes wrong. We carefully review every line of your loan agreements, promissory notes, and deeds of trust, identifying risks and ensuring compliance with California Civil Code § 2920 et seq. (governing mortgage and deed of trust laws).</p>
<p>When we draft or review these documents, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure interest rate terms, payment schedules, and default provisions are fair and enforceable.</li>
<li>Confirm that security instruments (like deeds of trust) are properly prepared and recorded.</li>
<li>Review escrow instructions and payoff statements for accuracy and legal compliance.</li>
<li>Identify and correct any hidden lender terms or “gotcha” clauses that could harm your financial position.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Financing Documents We Handle</p>
<ul>
<li>Promissory Notes: We make sure repayment terms, interest rates, and default remedies are clear and enforceable.</li>
<li>Deeds of Trust and Mortgages: We review and draft documents that secure your loan while protecting your property rights.</li>
<li>Loan Agreements: From private lenders to institutional financing, we structure agreements to minimize risk.</li>
<li>Subordination and Intercreditor Agreements: We ensure priority disputes between multiple lenders are resolved up front.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Approach</p>
<p>We combine legal precision with real-world experience. We know how lenders, escrow officers, and title companies operate in the Bay Area—and we ensure your financing documents align with both legal requirements and market realities. Our goal is to give you clarity, security, and confidence throughout the financing process.</p>
<p>Why Choose Us?</p>
<p>Because property financing is too important to leave to chance. Whether you’re securing funding for an investment property or reviewing loan terms for a personal purchase, we take the time to identify potential disputes before they arise and protect your interests from start to finish.</p>
