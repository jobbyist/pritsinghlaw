    <h1>Premises Liability</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>Accidents happen—but that doesn’t mean landlords are automatically on the hook. In California, premises liability law can feel like a minefield for property owners, especially in tenant-friendly cities like San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and Richmond. Tenants (and their attorneys) often claim that a landlord’s property conditions caused their injury, even when the real story is far more complicated.</p>
<p>We defend Bay Area property owners against these claims, protecting your property rights, your reputation, and your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a Free Landlord Defense Consultation today and let’s talk about your case.</strong></p>
<p>What Is Premises Liability?</p>
<p>Under California Civil Code § 1714, property owners must act with “ordinary care” to prevent harm to others on their property. The seminal case, Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, eliminated the old rules that treated guests and trespassers differently and established a general duty of care for all property owners.</p>
<p>But here’s the key: being responsible doesn’t mean being liable for every injury. We make sure the law is applied fairly, and we fight exaggerated claims head-on.</p>
<p>We defend landlords against a wide range of claims, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slip-and-Fall Accidents: Wet floors, icy steps, or poorly maintained common areas.</li>
<li>Trip Hazards: Uneven pavement, broken tiles, or stairway defects.</li>
<li>Inadequate Lighting Claims: Tenants blaming you for accidents in dimly lit hallways or parking areas.</li>
<li>Alleged Building Code Violations: Claims that “unsafe conditions” caused an injury.</li>
<li>Elevator/Escalator Injuries: Accidents in multi-unit buildings or commercial spaces.</li>
<li>Negligent Security Claims: Assaults or thefts where tenants blame a lack of security cameras or locks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Premises Liability Is Tough in the Bay Area</p>
<p>Tenant-friendly courts in the Bay Area often give the benefit of the doubt to plaintiffs, especially when injuries are involved. To win, you need more than a good story—you need airtight evidence and legal strategy.</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate immediately, gathering photos, inspection logs, and witness statements.</li>
<li>Challenge false or exaggerated claims, often revealing that a tenant’s own negligence caused the accident.</li>
<li>Bring in building and safety experts to disprove allegations of unsafe conditions.</li>
<li>Ensure habitability rules are interpreted correctly—many tenants misstate what is actually required under Civil Code § 1941.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Legal Edge: Rowland Factors</p>
<p>The California Supreme Court in Rowland v. Christian outlined several factors that courts consider when deciding liability, such as foreseeability of harm, moral blame, and the burden of preventing harm. We use these factors in your favor—arguing that you acted as a reasonable property owner and that the alleged harm was not foreseeable.</p>
