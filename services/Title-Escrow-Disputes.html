    <h1>Title &amp; Escrow Disputes</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
<p>Title and escrow are supposed to make real estate transactions smooth, but when something goes wrong, it can stop a closing in its tracks or create costly legal battles after the deal is done. Unresolved liens, title defects, or escrow errors can threaten your property rights and even trigger lawsuits.</p>
<p>We help homeowners, landlords, buyers, and investors across San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, and the greater Bay Area resolve title and escrow disputes, ensuring your property is clear, your closing is secure, and your rights are fully protected.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a Title &amp; Escrow Consultation to prevent surprises that could derail your transaction.</strong></p>
<p>What Causes Title &amp; Escrow Disputes?</p>
<p>Title disputes often arise when ownership isn’t clear or there are hidden claims on the property. Escrow disputes occur when funds or documents aren’t handled properly. Common issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liens or Judgments: Unpaid debts, contractor liens, or tax liens that cloud title.</li>
<li>Errors in Deeds: Mistakes in legal descriptions or prior transfers.</li>
<li>Fraudulent Documents: Forged deeds or improper transfers recorded on title.</li>
<li>Escrow Mismanagement: Funds held incorrectly, missed instructions, or misapplied payments.</li>
<li>Title Insurance Claims: Denials or disputes with your title insurer when defects are discovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>What We Will Do for You</p>
<p>We take a hands-on, strategic approach to resolving title and escrow problems. When you hire us, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a full title review to identify liens, encumbrances, or errors.</li>
<li>Communicate with title companies and escrow officers to correct or resolve issues before closing.</li>
<li>File quiet title actions (under CCP § 760.010) when ownership disputes arise.</li>
<li>Pursue claims against title insurers if they fail to cover valid title defects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Negotiate settlements or releases of liens so that your property is free and clear.</p>
<p>Title Insurance Disputes</p>
<p>Title insurance is supposed to protect you from hidden ownership problems, but insurers often push back on coverage. We know how to challenge title insurance denials and make sure your coverage is enforced when it matters most—especially when a defect is discovered after closing.</p>
<p>Escrow Problems – How We Step In</p>
<p>Escrow companies are meant to be neutral, but errors in escrow can create major legal headaches. We step in to correct misapplied funds, enforce escrow instructions, or pursue claims when escrow agents fail to perform their duties.</p>
