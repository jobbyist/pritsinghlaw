    <h1>Quiet Title Actions</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>When multiple parties claim ownership of the same parcel, a quiet title action operates as a court-issued reset button that wipes away competing claims and delivers a judgment confirming who truly owns the property.</p>

    <p>In the Bay Area—where unresolved title defects can freeze million-dollar deals—we guide owners in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, Fremont, and beyond through every step of a quiet title lawsuit.</p>

    <p><strong>Schedule a Quiet Title Consultation today and move your project forward with confidence.</strong></p>
