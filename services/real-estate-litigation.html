            Unclear ownership or competing claims to a property can stop sales,
            refinancing, or development in their tracks. Our team brings quiet
            title lawsuits under California Code of Civil Procedure § 760.010
            et seq. to eliminate disputes and ensure you have a clear,
            marketable title.

          <p class="card__text">
            If someone has been using your property as if it’s their own for
            years, they may attempt to gain legal ownership through adverse
            possession. California law (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 325) requires
            continuous, open, and hostile possession for five years, plus
            payment of property taxes. We aggressively defend property owners
            against adverse possession claims—or assert ownership when the facts
            are on your side.

          <p class="card__text">
            Landlords often face premises liability lawsuits, such as
            slip-and-fall or property-related injury claims. California law (see
            <em>Rowland v. Christian</em> (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108) holds property
            owners to a duty of care, but that doesn’t mean every accident is
            the landlord’s fault. We defend landlords against fraudulent or
            exaggerated claims, protecting your reputation and financial
            interests.

          <p class="card__text">
            When banks or lenders move to foreclose on your property, time is
            critical. We file temporary restraining orders (TROs) and injunctions
            to stop wrongful foreclosures and give you time to assert your legal
            rights. California’s Homeowner Bill of Rights (Civ. Code §§ 2923.5,
            2924.11) provides powerful protections we can use in your favor.

            Homeowners’ associations (HOAs) often enforce Covenants, Conditions

            repairs, assessments, or alleged violations. We represent homeowners
            and associations in disputes involving enforcement of CC&amp;Rs

  <!-- ========== LEGAL BACKGROUND ========== -->

      <h2 class="section__title">California Law on Real Estate Litigation</h2>
      <p>
        Real estate disputes often involve California Civil Code § 1102, which
        requires sellers to disclose known property defects, and California Code
        of Civil Procedure § 760.020, which governs quiet title actions. Cases
        such as <em>Lingsch v. Savage</em> (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 729 have set
        critical standards for misrepresentation and non-disclosure, guiding
        how these disputes are resolved.
