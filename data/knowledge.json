      "text": "Boundary disputes arise when property owners disagree about property lines, encroachments, or use rights. These disputes can involve fences, structures, trees, driveways, or landscaping that cross property boundaries. Resolution may require survey analysis, title review, deed interpretation, and negotiation or litigation. We help clients resolve boundary conflicts through negotiation, mediation, or court action. Common issues include fence line disputes, encroaching structures, adverse possession claims, prescriptive easements, and survey discrepancies. Early resolution is important to prevent escalation and preserve neighbor relations. Legal remedies may include quiet title actions, declaratory relief, injunctions, or damages."
